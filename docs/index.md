## Overview

`csnaketerm` is a command-line program written in Node.js that implements the classic [Snake arcade game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_%28video_game_genre%29). It is best played on an 80x24 terminal screen, though larger terminal dimensions are also acceptable.

## Installation

### Linux

#### Debian 10, Ubuntu 18.04+, Linux Mint 20

deb installer: [csnaketerm_0.1.0-1_amd64.deb](./csnaketerm_0.1.0-1_amd64.deb)

Thanks [@XRFXLP](https://github.com/XRFXLP) for testing the deb installer on Linux Mint.

#### Fedora 32+, CentOS Stream 8, CentOS Linux 8, openSUSE Leap 15.2

rpm installer: [csnaketerm-0.1.0-1.fc33.noarch.rpm](./csnaketerm-0.1.0-1.fc33.noarch.rpm)

Probably works on RHEL 8 as well but yet to be tested.

Note for openSUSE users: `zypper` may warn you that the installer is unsigned. Choose `i`gnore if you trust the installer.

#### Manjaro

Compressed tarball: [csnaketerm-0.1.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst](./csnaketerm-0.1.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst)

Thanks [@Steffan153](https://github.com/Steffan153) for providing the package converted from the deb installer using `debtap` and testing it on Manjaro. Should work on Arch as well but yet to be tested.
